# 🌐 Frontend Projects Portfolio by Ali Haider

Welcome to my personal web development project repository! 👨‍💻  
This collection includes a variety of frontend projects — small, big, simple, creative, and functional — built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React**.

These projects reflect my continuous learning journey in frontend development, moving from static websites to dynamic, interactive web applications.
