        <p id="para">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah</b> was a man of incredible vision, determination, and integrity. His tireless efforts, unmatched leadership, and strong belief in justice led to the creation of Pakistanâ€”a separate homeland for Muslims where they could live with freedom and dignity. Jinnah's principles of unity, faith, and discipline continue to guide us even today. He faced immense challenges with courage and never wavered in his mission. His legacy is not just in the land he helped create, but in the values he stood for. We are forever grateful for his sacrifices, wisdom, and the path he paved for generations to come. Truly, he was a leader born once in a century.</p>
